PROBLEM: we use a fixed schema to validate the input data, by pattern mismatch the data will be skipped
TODO: dynamic schema for accepting dynamic changes
NEED: dynamic changes constrains

PROBLEM: we don't validate the logic of the HAZOP data
TODO: validation schema
NEED: rules, what are acceptable in HAZOP and what are not

IMPROVEMENT: TripleStore SOH API (SPARQL over HTML)  to an API using requests or SPARQLWrapper packages.
ADVANTAGES: better control over request/response operations, customization.
