PROBLEM: We use a fixed schema to validate the input data, by pattern mismatch the data will be skipped.\
TODO: Dynamic schema for accepting dynamic changes.\
NEED: Dynamic changes constrains.

PROBLEM: We don't validate the logic of the HAZOP data.\
TODO: Validation schema.\
NEED: Rules, what are acceptable in HAZOP and what are not.

IMPROVEMENT: TripleStore SOH API (SPARQL over HTML) to an API using requests or SPARQLWrapper packages.\
