# Problem Analysis

here, an analysis section would be nice. from your motivation and state of the art, you should derive a list 
of requirements that your concept later on should solve. e.g.:
- HAZOPs need to be stored
- HAZOPs need to be machinereadable
- ...
each requirement should have an argument, either from literature or logically derived
